End-to-end analytics project using SQL and Python to evaluate vendor efficiency.
# 🧠 Vendor Performance Analytics Project

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes vendor/supplier performance using SQL and Python to identify top and underperforming suppliers.  
It uses KPI metrics like **delivery time**, **quality score**, and **cost variance** to generate performance insights and visualize supplier efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate vendor delivery, quality, and cost metrics  
- Calculate performance scores and identify underperforming vendors  
- Visualize KPIs using Python libraries  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL (SQLite):** KPI calculation and data querying  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data generation — synthetic vendor dataset created in Python  
2. SQL analysis — KPI computation and vendor ranking  
3. Python visualization — bar plots for top vendors  
4. Insight extraction — identify areas for vendor improvement
